                    To receive food assistance benefits, my household must follow all the rules. If any
                    member
                    breaks any of these rules on purpose s/he can be barred from receiving food assistance
                    benefits from 12 months to permanently. A court can also order the individual off the
                    program for an additional 18 months. In addition, s/he can be fined up to $250,000,
                    imprisoned up to 20 years or both. S/he may also be subject to prosecution under the
                    applicable State and Federal laws. If you are found to have used or received benefits in
                    a
                    transaction involving the sale of firearms, ammunition or explosives, you will be
                    permanently ineligible to receive SNAP benefits upon the first occasion of such
                    violation.
                    If you have been found guilty of having trafficked benefits for an aggregate amount of
                    $500
                    or more, you will be permanently ineligible to receive SNAP benefits upon the first
                    occasion
                    of such violation. If you have been found to have made a fraudulent statement or
                    representation with respect to your identity of place of residence in order to receive
                    multiple SNAP benefits simultaneously, you will be ineligible to participate in the
                    program
                    for a period of 10 years. If you are fleeing to avoid prosecution, custody, or
                    confinement,
                    after conviction for a crime or an attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony, or are
                    in
                    violation of probation or parole imposed under a federal or state law, you are
                    ineligible
                    for food assistance. If you are convicted of using or receiving food assistance benefits
                    in
                    a transaction involving the sale of a controlled substance, you will be ineligible for
                    24
                    months for the first violation and permanently for the second violation. If you are
                    convicted of a federal or state felony that has an element of possession, use, or
                    distribution of a controlled substance, you are ineligible for food assistance. If a
                    court
                    of law finds you guilty of using or receiving benefits in a transaction involving the
                    sale
                    of a controlled substance, you will not be eligible for benefits for two years for the
                    first
                    offense and permanently for the second offense. Do not trade or sell food assistance
                    benefits or EBT cards. Do not use food assistance benefits to buy nonfood items, such as
                    alcohol or cigarettes, or to pay on credit accounts. Do not purchase food on credit with
                    SNAP benefits. Do not use someone elseâ€™s food assistance benefits, identification card
                    or

                    household may be barred from participation as a representative for up to one year or may
                    be
                    subject to fines and/or prosecution if s/he breaks any rules on purpose.
